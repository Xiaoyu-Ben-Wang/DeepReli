DeepReli is a deep learning model built for a data science and AI hackathon hosted by STEMFellowship. It analyzes text from news articles about COVID-19 and outputs a reliability score that helps determine if the content is likely to be reliable or unreliable. It was built using Python, TF/Keras, and hosted on the streamlit platform.
