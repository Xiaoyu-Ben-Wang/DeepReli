My future goals are to be involved in oncology and/or stem cell regenerative therapies. More specifically, I am interested in characterizing cancer cells and being able to specifically target them for removal. Conversely, with stem cell therapies I am interested in being able to extract, preserve, and innoculate for specialized treatments.

This is an interesting exercise in problem solving that brings together my interests in sociology and will allow me to learn about the challenges (and advantages) of observing human behavior from a statistical perspective. I look forward to learning the technical skills of course, but also to get a hands on experience with extracting patterns of behavior from data.
