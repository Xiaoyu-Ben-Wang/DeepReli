I have a background in neuroscience before transferring to computer science. Throughout my studies, I've remained passionate about working on projects that may benefit the health sciences industry. I'm specifically interested in how we can use different techniques to process data from brain-computer interfaces. I've had a bit of experience working with combining neuroscience and programming through my experience with local research-based startups such as NeurAlbertaTech or 8BitCortex and I plan on continuing my studies through future opportunities that will improve my knowledge of how machine learning can be applied to these fields.

I have taken a personal interest working on projects that exist at the intersection of computer science and health. In the past, I have attempted working with public health data and writing programs that apply simple statistical analysis to the information. Throughout this event, I hope to learn even more about how data science can be used to understand the world around us as well as discover more robust and complex approaches to data science.
