<h2 style='text-align: center;'>Xiaoyu (Ben) Wang</h2>
I used to be a neuroscience major before tranferring to computer science. Throughout my studies, I've remained passionate about working on projects that may benefit the health sciences industry, specifically in projects that solve problems existing at the intersection of these two fields. This includes programs that analyze feedback from brain-computer interfaces, mental health tracking and analytics, or developing solutions that help identify fake news articles.

 Through my participation in the Big Data Challenge, I hope to learn more about how data science can be used to understand the world around us, as well as discover novel solutions to old problems using data science. For our DeepReli project, I am responsible for developing data scraping and preprocessing algorithms as well as the creation of this website.
