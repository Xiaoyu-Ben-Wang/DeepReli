<h2 style='text-align: center;'>Yutong (Jessica) Li</h2>

I have a background in neuroscience, specifically neural stem cell biology during my Bachelors of Biology undergraduate degree, as I researched methods to improve neurodegenerative outcomes by engaging our neural stem cells. I have a personal interest in utilizing artificial intelligence tools like machine learning for precision medicine to improve patient outcomes, and I plan to continue my studies in the intersection between data science and health science.


Through participating in the Big Data Challenge 2021, I hope to learn more about the current data analysis trends in the AI field and implement these methods in my future data science projects. I also hope to improve my technical skills in data science to implement them in my future studies.
